# AdvancedwebdesignStudentpodsbookingsystem
A booking system for student pods 


This project is a simple web-based study pod booking system built using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows students to log in, book pods between 8:00 AM and 8:00 PM, and includes validations for time limits, pod capacity, and duplicate bookings. The system also has an undo option using a stack and displays real-time booking insights, making it user-friendly and functional without relying on any external libraries.
